  * AND (.), OR (+),  NOT ( `'` ), XOR.
  * NAND, NOR, XNOR.
* Truth Tables.
* The dual of a boolean expression.
* The duality principle.
* Axioms and Theorems of Boolean Algebra.
* Logic Gate Symbols.
* Variable vs Literal vs Term.
* **Product Term** vs **Sum Term**.
* **Complement** of a function.
* Standard Forms:
  * **Sum of Products (SOP)**.
  * **Product of Sums (POS)**.
* **Minterm** = Standard Product.
* **Maxterm** = Standard Sum.
* **Canonical Forms**:
  * **Sum of Minterms**.
  * **Product of Maxterms**.
* Get the **Boolean expression** from the **truth table**.
* **SOP** & **POS** from truth table.
* Drawing the **logic diagram** of the circuit.
* Drawing using **NAND** and **NOR**.

### *Simplifying logic circuits*

By reducing the number of terms, the number of literals, or both in a Boolean expression.

***

### A general conversion procedure:

To convert from one canonical form to another, interchange the symbols $\sum$ and $\prod$ and list those numbers missing from the original form. 

***
### Important Notes:

* The maxterm with subscript `j` is a complement of the minterm with the same subscript `j` and vice versa.
 $$ i.e. \qquad M_j = m{'}_j$$
* The **complement** of a function expressed as the **sum of minterms** equals the sum of minterms missing from the original function.
* The implementation of Boolean functions with **NAND** gates requires that the functions be in **sum-of-products** form.
* The implementation of Boolean functions with **NOR** gates requires that the functions be in **product-of-sums** form.
* The total number of minterms or maxterms for a boolean functions is $2^n$ where n is the number of binary variables.
* To find the **complement** of a Boolean function from the truth table:
    1-  form a minterm for each combination that produces a 0 in the function and then 
    2- **ORing** those terms.
