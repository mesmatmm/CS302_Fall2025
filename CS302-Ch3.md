### Important Notes:

* **Gate-level minimization** is the design task of finding an optimal gate-level implementation of the Boolean functions describing a digital circuit.
* The complexity of the digital logic gates that implement a Boolean function is directly
related to the complexity of the algebraic expression from which the function is implemented.
* The **map method** presented here provides a simple and straightforward procedure for minimizing Boolean functions. 
* The map method is known as **the Karnaugh map or K-map**.
* A **K-map** is a diagram made up of squares, with each square representing one minterm
of the function that is to be minimized.
* The **simplified expressions** produced by the map are always in one of the **two standard
forms: sum of products or product of sums**.
* **The simplest expression is not unique**: It is sometimes possible to find two or more expressions that satisfy the minimization criteria.
